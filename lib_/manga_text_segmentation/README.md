## Example
Input:

## Dataset
Our label masks are available at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4511796). For the original Manga109 images, please refer to [Manga 109 website](http://www.manga109.org/en/).

## Code
The important notebooks that led to our best models are: **model** (resnet34 from modelDict) and **refine** (model/resnet34 path). The rest were either experiments or visualization. Check in notebook **extra** to view how predictions are loaded. 

## Try it out
You can try out predicting by opening the [Predict notebook](/examples/Manga_Text_Segmentation_Predict.ipynb) in colab.

## Additional Resources
A further extensive detail of our research can be found in [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03997). This includes more examples and other things we tried before reaching the end result explained in our paper.

abstract="The detection and recognition of unconstrained text is an open problem in research. Text in comic books has unusual styles that raise many challenges for text detection. This work aims to binarize text in a comic genre with highly sophisticated text styles: Japanese manga. To overcome the lack of a manga dataset with text annotations at a pixel level, we create our own. To improve the evaluation and search of an optimal model, in addition to standard metrics in binarization, we implement other special metrics. Using these resources, we designed and evaluated a deep network model, outperforming current methods for text binarization in manga in most metrics.",
